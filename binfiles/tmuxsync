## NOTE: currently this script doesn't have any syncing logic.
## It simply links to this session, all of the windows in the session passed as argument1.
## In the future I hope to make it idempotent.
## I could not find a quick way to get the tty or the pid of the windows.
## But, the good news is that renaming a window in one session changes it in all sessions.
## Therefore, I can save the name in a var, rename, look for it in the other session, change the name back.
## That will be the next advance.
